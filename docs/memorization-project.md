# Near-Verbatim Memorization Project: Vision and Reader Integration

Status: Brainstorm
Date: 2026-02-20

## 1. The Project

A lifelong practice of selecting foundational works worth "playing back" near-verbatim in one's head, as a method of retrieval practice, elaboration, and spaced repetition for thinking about the subject matter therein.

The goal is not rote recitation but **generative internalization**: carrying a text so deeply that recalling a passage re-enacts a method of attention, not just a conclusion. The experience of holding multiple such works simultaneously creates a permanent "internal symposium" — works in dialogue with each other across traditions, generating new thought at their intersections.

## 2. Selection Criteria

Five criteria for what makes a work memorization-worthy, roughly ranked:

1. **Generative inexhaustibility** — does the passage keep producing new thought on each mental replay, or does it "bottom out"?
2. **Prose distinctiveness** — is the writing memorable *as writing*? Distinctive prose is dramatically easier to retain than generic academic prose.
3. **Structural memorability** — does the work's architecture aid recall? Numbered propositions, recurring refrains, dialogic structure, poetic meter all help enormously.
4. **Density** — how much is packed into each sentence? A 200-page work where every paragraph rewards memorization beats an 800-page work where only the peaks do.
5. **Self-sufficiency** — can the work stand alone, or does it require extensive external apparatus?

These criteria explain why lecture notes (Nicomachean Ethics) score poorly despite philosophical importance — the prose reads as notes because it is notes. Compare PI, where numbering, interlocutors, and recurring images (beetle in the box, the fly-bottle) create mnemonic scaffolding naturally.

## 3. First Targets

| # | Work | Language | Tier | Notes |
|---|------|----------|------|-------|
| 1 | Wittgenstein, *Philosophische Untersuchungen* | German | Elevation | ~14 years of deep engagement; 2-year weekly Tractatus study group in undergrad |
| 2 | Hume, *Enquiries* (both) | English | Fresh | Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding + Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals; ~300pp of peak 18th-c. English prose; complete epistemology-to-ethics arc |
| 3 | Darwin, *On the Origin of Species* | English | Fresh | One sustained argument; rhetorical strategy is itself a masterclass in scientific reasoning |
| 4 | Hardy, *A Mathematician's Apology* | English | Fresh | Short; finest English prose by a scientist; meditation on mathematical beauty and the life of the mind |
| 5 | Goethe, *Faust Part I* | German | Fresh | Foundation of modern literary German; broader register than Rilke; rhymed verse aids memorization; doubles as German language recovery |

### Tier Definitions

- **Elevation**: works already deeply familiar that need to be brought to verbatim recall. Quickest wins — marginal effort is low, and the experience teaches memorization process before tackling fresh works.
- **Deep familiarity, fresh memorization**: works known intellectually but not internalized at the sentence level.
- **Substantially new acquisition**: building both understanding and memorization in parallel.

## 4. Broader Portfolio (Under Consideration)

### Philosophy
- **Descartes, *Meditations on First Philosophy*** — short, crystalline prose, elegant six-meditation structure. For someone steeped in phenomenology, having Descartes for mental playback creates productive friction with Heidegger and Levinas.
- **Kant, *Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals*** — compact, tightly argued, genuine rhetorical force. The Groundwork gives you Kant's ethical core in a holdable form (where the Critiques are too vast).
- **Spinoza, *Ethics*** — geometric proof format (definitions, axioms, propositions, QED) is extraordinary mnemonic scaffolding. The most radical response to Descartes ever written.
- **Wittgenstein, *Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus*** — partially ingrained from undergrad study group. Having both Wittgensteins creates a philosophical stereo effect. Numbered propositions score near-perfectly on structural memorability.
- **Kierkegaard, *Fear and Trembling*** — short, structurally elegant, hauntingly distinctive prose. Sits at the intersection of philosophical and literary interests.
- **Marcus Aurelius, *Meditations*** — literally written as a personal memorization/recollection practice. Designed to be recalled during life rather than at a desk.
- **Pascal, *Pensees*** — fragmentary (requires selectivity), but the best fragments are among the most generative in the tradition.
- **Rousseau, *The Social Contract*** — compact, radical, almost mathematical structure. Direct influence on Kant, complex antagonism with Nietzsche.
- **Hobbes, *Leviathan* (Parts I-II)** — most muscular English prose of the 17th century. The founding gesture of modern political philosophy.

### Literature
- **Homer, *Iliad* and *Odyssey*** — already partially ingrained in Greek from undergrad. Original memorization texts; formulaic structure is literally mnemonic technology. The Odyssey's themes (homecoming, identity, endurance) deepen with age.
- **Rilke, *Duino Elegies*** — philosophical in a way connecting to phenomenological interests. Ten elegies, compressed form. Save for when German is fully reactivated by PI + Faust.
- **Dante, *Inferno*** — terza rima is magnificent mnemonic technology. Structurally perfect for memorization (spatial, systematic descent). Would add Italian to the multilingual dimension.
- **Dostoevsky, *Notes from Underground*** — short, philosophically dense, structurally tight. The Underground Man's voice is so distinctive it practically memorizes itself.
- **Borges, *Ficciones*** (selected stories) — individual stories short enough to memorize as units. Philosophical thought experiments disguised as fiction. Connective tissue to almost everything else on the list.

### Science and Mathematics
- **Euclid, *Elements* Books I-VI** — propositional structure inherently memorable. Reconstructing Euclidean geometry from memory is transformative for mathematical thinking. Gives you deductive reasoning at its purest (where Darwin gives you inductive).
- **Einstein, "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies" (1905)** — ~30 pages, clear prose, architectural beauty. Two postulates, then relentless working-out of consequences.
- **Turing, "On Computable Numbers" (1936)** — short enough to be feasible, foundational enough to justify it.

### Wisdom Traditions
- **Tao Te Ching** — 81 brief chapters, many under 100 words, each inexhaustible. Most memorization-efficient philosophical text ever written. Offers a mode of thinking radically different from the Western tradition — permanent counterpoint.
- **The Dhammapada** — most compact and memorizable Buddhist text. Paired verses, self-contained but contributing to a whole vision.

### Analytic Tradition
- **Quine, "Two Dogmas of Empiricism"** — ~20 pages, beautifully written, attacks the analytic/synthetic distinction. With PI in memory, creates rich internal dialogue about meaning and reference.

## 5. The Internal Symposium

A key emergent property: many of these works are in direct dialogue with each other.

- Descartes provokes Spinoza provokes Hume
- Kant responds to Hume
- Kierkegaard responds to Kant
- Nietzsche responds to everyone
- The Tractatus and PI are in permanent dialogue
- Darwin (inductive) and Euclid (deductive) embody the two fundamental modes of scientific thought
- The Tao Te Ching provides permanent counterpoint to the entire Western philosophical tradition

Carrying all of these simultaneously would be like having a permanent philosophical symposium running in one's head. This "network effect" is itself a selection criterion — works that create more connections to the existing portfolio are more valuable than isolated additions.

## 6. Practical Architecture

At 36 with a lifelong horizon: ~15-25 works total at full commitment level (each taking 1-3 years of sustained practice, with 40+ productive years). Each slot is precious.

**Scheduling insight**: alternate between tiers (elevation vs. fresh acquisition) to avoid the project becoming either too easy or too grueling. Start with two simultaneously: one elevation text (PI) and one fresh text in English (Hume), so you're not fighting two language-recovery projects at once.

**Multilingual dimension**: German (PI, Faust, later Rilke), Greek (Homer), English (Hume, Darwin, Hardy), possibly Italian (Dante). The memorization process itself becomes the vehicle for rebuilding/maintaining language fluency.

## 7. How Reader Can Serve This Project

### Current Capabilities (Already Useful)

The existing Reader training loop is well-suited to passage-level memorization:

1. **Paced reading phase** — saccade/RSVP presentation builds familiarity with rhythm and structure before recall begins
2. **Word-by-word recall** — forces exact reconstruction with immediate feedback on misses
3. **Scaffold/no-scaffold modes** — first-letter hints for early learning, bare recall for mastery
4. **Repeat-until-mastery** — paragraphs repeat at <90% score; adjustable threshold
5. **Passage capture** — can save high-value passages for dedicated recall training
6. **Review state tracking** — passages marked hard/easy/done; review counts tracked
7. **Detail word toggle** — can include/exclude proper nouns and numbers from scoring
8. **Tab preview in no-scaffold** — timed preview of remaining words; previewed words forfeit score

### Gaps for This Use Case

1. **No spaced repetition scheduling** — review queue is manual, not SM-2/FSRS-based. For a lifelong project spanning dozens of works and hundreds of passages, algorithmic scheduling is essential.
2. **No retention curve tracking** — no metrics on forgetting rate or optimal review timing per passage.
3. **Single-sentence drill limitation** — random drill rounds are exactly one sentence. Near-verbatim memorization requires building from sentences to paragraphs to sections to chapters.
4. **No mastery threshold above 90%** — current repeat threshold is 90%. Verbatim recall demands 100% (or near-100% with typo tolerance only).
5. **No multi-session progress view** — can't easily see "I mastered this paragraph 5 days ago at 97%, should I re-check?"
6. **No passage sequencing** — can't define an ordered curriculum through a work (Chapter 1 passages before Chapter 2, etc.)
7. **No "mental playback" mode** — a mode where the user replays from memory without typing, self-scoring on internal accuracy. Useful for long passages where typing every word is impractical.
8. **No inter-work navigation** — no concept of a "memorization portfolio" spanning multiple works with cross-work scheduling.

### Extension Directions

Ordered roughly by leverage and feasibility:

#### A. Spaced Repetition Scheduling for Passages
The single highest-leverage addition. Implement an FSRS-style scheduler over the existing passage store:
- After each review, compute next review date based on score and history
- Surface "due for review" passages automatically
- Track stability/difficulty per passage
- This transforms the existing passage capture + review workflow from manual to algorithmic

#### B. Progressive Drill Granularity
Build from sentences to paragraphs to sections:
- Allow drill rounds of configurable length (1 sentence, 2 sentences, full paragraph, multi-paragraph)
- Track mastery at each granularity level
- Graduation: once individual sentences are mastered, combine into paragraph-level drills
- This maps directly to the memorization process: learn parts, then assemble into wholes

#### C. Work-Level Curriculum Structure
A "memorization project" entity that organizes passages from a single work:
- Ordered sequence of passages covering the work
- Progress dashboard: which passages mastered, which due for review, overall completion
- Import support: load a work and segment it into memorization units (could leverage existing article/passage infrastructure)

#### D. Elevated Mastery Thresholds
- Configurable target score (90% / 95% / 100%)
- "Verbatim mode" where only exact matches count (no Levenshtein tolerance)
- Streak tracking: passage considered "mastered" only after N consecutive perfect recalls

#### E. Mental Playback Mode
For long passages where typing every word is impractical:
- Display passage with progressive reveal (line by line or sentence by sentence)
- User self-reports: "I had this" / "I missed something" / "I blanked"
- Optionally spot-check: hide random sentences within a mastered passage for typed verification
- Lower friction than full word-by-word recall; appropriate for maintenance reviews

#### F. Portfolio Dashboard
Cross-work view of the memorization project:
- All works with progress indicators
- Combined review queue across works
- Session planner: "today's practice" drawing from multiple works based on scheduling
- Statistics: total passages mastered, retention rates, time invested per work

### Relationship to KnOS Discussion Integration

The memorization project and the KnOS discussion feature serve complementary purposes:
- **Memorization** targets verbatim internalization of the text itself
- **Discussion** targets comprehension, elaboration, and critical engagement with the text's ideas

A natural workflow: read a passage in paced mode → discuss with KnOS tutor to deepen understanding → enter memorization drill on the passage → review via spaced repetition. The discussion layer helps build the deep comprehension that makes verbatim recall meaningful rather than mechanical.

## 8. Open Questions

1. **Scoring for verse**: rhymed/metrical poetry (Faust, Homer) has different memorization dynamics than prose. Should there be a verse-aware mode that scores line-by-line rather than word-by-word?
2. **Original language support**: Greek and German text input and display. Current tokenizer handles Latin script; Greek requires testing. Is right-to-left or non-Latin support needed for future works?
3. **Audio dimension**: memorization traditions often involve reading aloud. Is there a role for audio playback (TTS or recorded) as a study aid alongside visual presentation?
4. **Collaboration with the Tractatus study group model**: the conversation notes that communal sustained attention was the method that first deeply ingrained texts. Is there a social/shared dimension worth considering, or is this inherently a solo practice?
5. **How to handle translations**: for works being memorized in translation (Hume is not an issue, but Tao Te Ching would be), does the Reader need dual-text support (original + translation)?
